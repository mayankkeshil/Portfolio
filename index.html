        <p><span class="bold bigger">Hi, I'm Mayank</span> and I am an aspiring 16 year old <span class="bold bigger">to-be entrepreneur</span> raised in Reading, England. My curiosity leans towards subjects that are <span class="bold bigger">rarely discussed among the youth</span> that would majorly improve our lives if we did. Such subjects include <span class="bold bigger">financial literacy, property investment and</span> <span class="bold bigger">web development</span> to name a few.</p>
        <p>We have all been forced and brainwashed into the traditional system which the governments have full control over. One of my goals is to <span class="bold bigger">break out of this system</span> and to show others how much control they have over us. I won't let it take too much time but I'll give an example, <span class="bold bigger">money</span> nowadays is <span class="bold bigger">not backed by a tangible asset</span> as it was in the past. This means that governments can print as much of it without consequence for THEM, but it majorly affects the people. This is why crypto is backed so much nowadays and it is why governments are introducing bans on <span class="bold bigger">crypto</span> and creating new <span class="bold bigger">central bank digital currencies</span> owned entirely by the elites, <span class="bold bigger">for the public to stay within their grasp.</span></p>
      <p>This may have sounded like a conspiracy theory to you, but it is very true. <span class="bold bigger">Fragile, corrupt humans</span> that power <span class="bold bigger">governments</span> have <span class="bold bigger">complete power</span> over such a major thing in the world and it should not be that way.</p>
