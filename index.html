         <p><span class="bold bigger">Hi, I'm Mayank</span> and I am from <span class="bold bigger">Reading</span>. I started getting into web development at the age of <span class="bold bigger">11</span> when I had first started learning the basics of
           <span class="bold bigger">HTML</span> and <span class="bold bigger">CSS</span>. I built simple front-end projects like <span class="bold bigger">sign-in pages</span>, although not up to an actual developer's standards of course.
           <br><br>I am now entering my second year of sixth form, so this website's <span class="bold bigger">purpose</span> is to showcase my <span class="bold bigger">skills</span> and <span class="bold bigger">projects</span>
           that have been completed or are in progress. Currently I am focused on learning languages like <span class="bold bigger">JavaScript</span> and <span class="bold bigger">back-end languages</span> such as Python <span class="bold bigger">(Django)</span> to make my projects more interactive and polished. After all, front-end design is only <span class="bold bigger">half</span> of the equation to a website.
        <p id="project-intro">Below are some projects/investments that I have made in myself to know the real world better:</p>
